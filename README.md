## 👋 Hey there, I'm Chaman! 👨‍💻 

A **Computer Science** student with a passion for crafting **elegant code** and **seamless user experiences**. ✨

Currently exploring the realms of **blockchain**, **web development**, and **UI/UX design**, all while keeping my analytical skills sharp with a minor in **Financial Economics Data Analysis**. 

**My toolbox?**  Overflowing with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Java, Python, and a sprinkle of design magic. 🧰

**Check out some of my recent projects:**

- **Watery-3js:** Mesmerizing water simulation built with Three.js.  [github.com/2105789/Watery-3js](https://github.com/2105789/Watery-3js) 🌊
- **Scrambleo:** Real-time collaborative painting app powered by Next.js and Socket.io. [github.com/2105789/Scrambleo](https://github.com/2105789/Scrambleo) 🎨

**Let's connect!** I'm always down for a chat about tech, design, or the meaning of life (maybe). 😉
